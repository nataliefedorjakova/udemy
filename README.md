# Udemy Reservation Sharing Tool

A **private reservation system** for sharing a **single Udemy account** among team members without getting flagged for "suspicious activity." 
## Features
- **Book a Time Slot** 
- **Prevents Overlapping Reservations** 

## How It Works
1. **Log in** with your credentials.
2. **Pick a time slot**.
3. **Book your reservation** and enjoy exclusive, uninterrupted access.
4. **Watch Udemy courses** without getting locked out mid-lesson.


## Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/nataliefedorjakova/udemy.git
cd udemy

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the server
node app.js

## Future (ambitious) plans:
- Using clock instead of picking your times manually
- Testing edge cases
- Accessing the account using virtual remote desktop
- Formatting the page so it's not such an eyesore
- Creating several accounts with own unique passwords
- Adding information about who currently has the time slot booked
